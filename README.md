# und-comp: Understanding Computation


Currently I am working through [Understanding Computation](http://htchttp.s3.amazonaws.com/books/Understanding%20Computation.pdf) by Tom Stuart as part of [Cambridge Programmers' Study Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/). I am recoding examples in the book, starting with Chapter 2, in Python (original is in Ruby). This repo contains my code, or eventually will at any rate:) 

I will upload files corresponding to pages in the books. p. 23 is up!
